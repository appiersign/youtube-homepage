# Youtube Replica
This project is about Embedding Videos and Images to a Youtube page given in the Odin Project. As a way of contributing to Open Source. To be specific, Sign and Julia project is about "Remote Job Search" A Microverse journey "Lunch & Learns Webinar" given by Paul Rail. The project has quite a number of elements added to it. For instance, it has information to do with when it was published, the number of views and allows one to either like or dislike what they see. More so, it also an option to share the project link to anyone, if the viewers wish to do so. In addition to this, it has an up-next option whereby one is able to see what videos are next to play after the current video.
